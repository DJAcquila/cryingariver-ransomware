# cryingariver-ransomware
A quick implementation of a ransomware for studying purposes.

Studying the basics of ransomware-type malware helps to know how to avoid its dispersion and understanding how it works. This script will be part of a larger study carried out on this topic, which will result in a technical report on the ways of avoiding an ransomware-type attack.
As the project must be carried out more quickly, we were inspired by this model: https://github.com/tarcisio-marinho/GonnaCry
